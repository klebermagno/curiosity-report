# MARS REPORT #

Sprint-boot web application that shows the latest weather report from Mars.

It consumes a live NASA API which returns a list of daily weather reports received from the Curiosity rover currently on the surface of Mars.

Using this data, the application generates it's own JSON report API (/api/mars/report) and this under-pins a simple AJAX UI which displays the data in HTML.

The application is built and run using Maven.
